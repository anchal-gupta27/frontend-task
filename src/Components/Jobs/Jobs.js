                    Computer Science is the study of theory, engineering, experimentation that form the basis for the design and effectiveness of computers. It involves the study of algorithms and their application in the real world. Computer Science can be defined as the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that is the basis of the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to, information.
